# iWork Job Portal

iWork is a job portal built using HTML, CSS, and Django, featuring a cutting-edge AI-powered job recommender system. The recommender, **HGCNL-JRec**, leverages both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to provide highly relevant job recommendations to users based on their resumes and job interactions.

## üß† AI Recommender System: HGCNL-JRec

### Overview

The heart of this portal is the **HGCNL-JRec** recommender, a hybrid model that combines:
- **LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)** for topic modeling (via `gensim`)
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)** for learning from user-job-application relationships (via `PyTorch`)
- **spaCy** with custom entity rulers for extracting skills, degrees, and majors from resumes and job descriptions

### How It Works

1. **Resume & Job Parsing:**
   - When an employee uploads a PDF resume, it is parsed using `pdfminer` and cleaned with NLP techniques.
   - Skills, degrees, and majors are extracted using spaCy and custom entity rulers (`website/recommend/recFiles/`).
   - Job descriptions are similarly processed.

2. **Feature Embedding:**
   - Extracted features are embedded into a unified representation.
   - LDA assigns a topic to each resume/job for semantic grouping.

3. **Graph Construction:**
   - Users, jobs, and their interactions (applications) are represented as nodes and edges in a heterogeneous graph.
   - The graph is stored and updated in `website/recommend/recFiles/web_graph.pt`.

4. **Recommendation:**
   - The GNN model (HGCNL-JRec) learns from the graph structure and content features.
   - For a given user, the model recommends jobs they are most likely to be interested in, excluding those already applied to.
   - The top-K recommendations are returned and displayed in the UI.

### Code & Artifacts
- **Model code:** `website/recommend/recommeder.py`, `graph.py`, `preprocess.py`
- **Pretrained models and rulers:** `website/recommend/recFiles/`
- **Global variables:** `website/recommend/global_vars.py` (paths to models, rulers, and graph)

### Dependencies
- `torch`, `gensim`, `spacy`, `pdfminer`, `nltk`, and more (see `requirements.txt`)
- Pretrained spaCy entity rulers and LDA models are included in the repo for immediate use

### Customization & Extension
- You can retrain the LDA or GNN models with your own data
- Entity rulers for skills, degrees, and majors can be extended for new domains
- The recommender logic is modular and can be adapted for other recommendation tasks

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/benbarekfatima/JobPortal.git
    cd JobPortal
    ```
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv job_env
    # On Windows:
    job_env\Scripts\activate
    # On Unix/Mac:
    source job_env/bin/activate
    ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. **Download NLTK stopwords (if not auto-downloaded):**
    ```python
    python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('stopwords')"
    ```
5. **Apply migrations and create a superuser:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
6. **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
7. **Access the app:**  
   Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) in your browser.

## üåê Deployment

- **Vercel:** Configured via `vercel.json` to deploy using Python 3.9 and the Django WSGI entry point.

---

## üìÑ Notes

- **Resume Uploads:** Only PDF files are accepted.
- **Skills/majors/degrees extraction:** Uses custom spaCy entity rulers (see `website/recommend/recFiles/`).
- **Admin:** Access Django admin at `/admin/` after creating a superuser.
- **Customization:** You can extend the recommender, add new features, or modify the UI via the templates.
